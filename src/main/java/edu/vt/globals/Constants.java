    |   Use of Class Variables as Global Constants   |
    ==================================================
    All of the variables in this class are Class Variables (typed with the "static" keyword)
    with Constant values, which can be accessed in any class in the project by specifying
    Constants.CONSTANTNAME, i.e., ClassName.ClassVariableNameInCaps

    Constants are specified in capital letters.

    =====================================================
    |   Our Design Decision for Use of External Files   |
    =====================================================
    We decided to use directories external to our application for the storage and retrieval of user's files.
    We do not want to store/retrieve external files into/from our database for the following reasons:

        (a) Database storage and retrieval of large files as BLOB (Binary Large OBject) degrades performance.
        (b) BLOBs increase the database complexity.
        (c) The operating system handles the external files instead of the database management system.

    WildFly provides an internal web server, named Undertow, to access and display external files.
    See https://docs.wildfly.org/24/Admin_Guide.html#Undertow
